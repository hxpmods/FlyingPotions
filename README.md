# FlyingPotions
 Makes your Potions soar above the competition in Potion Craft.
 
 Each level of Levitation in a potion will increases it's lift, from lighter than a normal potion, to floating on the ceiling.
 Does *not* affect placing the Potion on the scales.
 
 # TODO
 
 -Create Mod Config. (Want *all* your potions up in the air?)
 -Make Bounce Potions Bounce. (Probably not.)
 -Make Stone Skin Potions Heavier? (May as well.)
